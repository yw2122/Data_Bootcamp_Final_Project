Project Description

This project will investigate factors that might cause child poverty in the United States and geographical variations at the county level. The main factors that are examined are family types (whether the child is raised by two or one parent in the family) and races. Also, the geographical distribution and variation of child poverty rates seem to correlate to the demographics of different areas. This projects will try to visualize the geographical variation and its correlation with one of the most outstanding demographics, which is racial distribution.
